# Additional exercises for PMT sessions

These are exercises I've used to supplement the tutorial sheets 
on the CO142 Discrete Structures and CO140 Logic courses 
conducted by the Department of Computing at Imperial College.

The exercises (here with solutions) aren't intended to replicate 
the sheets, but to stretch students to think slightly beyond the 
boundaries of the course. They aren't awfully advanced, although 
some more challenging questions have been marked with a star (*).

_Thanks to Jeremy Kong for providing the format and motivation 
as an undergraduate TA during my Logic course._
